# ${Chest \space Xrays \space Scanning}$

## ${Project \space Overview}$

This project works on **_the Preprocessing and Classification of the Scanned Images of Xrays Diagrams of Chest_** within three categories, **_first_**, Normal Chest, **_second_**, Bacteria Infected Chest, and **_third_**, Virus Infected Chest. Thus, the images are resized and then the model is trained with the accuracy of **_82% (approx.)_**. Since, the **_diseases by viruses and bacteria are different_** and show different morphological symptoms. Thus, the project is suitable and best needed for **_diagnosis of patient about various diseases of Trunk_**. It can also be enhanced further to improve its accuracy by **_Data Augmentation_**. The **_Project Structure_** contains the details of the data contained within the subfolders.
